# Security Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Baby Skuse website and provides guidelines for maintaining security.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Input Validation & Sanitization
- ✅ All form inputs are validated and sanitized
- ✅ Length limits on all text fields
- ✅ Email format validation
- ✅ Numeric validation for guest count
- ✅ XSS prevention through input sanitization

### 2. Rate Limiting
- ✅ IP-based rate limiting (5 submissions per hour per IP)
- ✅ Rate limit counters expire after 1 hour
- ✅ Prevents form spam and abuse

### 3. Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ Admin endpoint removed (no longer needed)
- ✅ No admin functionality exposed
- ✅ Reduced attack surface

### 4. Security Headers
- ✅ Content Security Policy (CSP)
- ✅ X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- ✅ X-Frame-Options: DENY
- ✅ X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- ✅ Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- ✅ Permissions-Policy configured

### 5. Environment & Configuration
- ✅ Environment variables properly configured
- ✅ .env file in .gitignore
- ✅ No sensitive data in version control

### 6. Dependencies
- ⚠️ 3 moderate vulnerabilities in nanoid package
- ✅ Regular npm audit checks
- ✅ Dependencies updated regularly

## Security Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Run `npm audit` and fix any vulnerabilities
- [ ] Ensure all environment variables are set
- [ ] Test form validation with malicious inputs
- [ ] Verify rate limiting is working
- [ ] Check security headers are applied

### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Weekly: Run `npm audit` and update dependencies
- [ ] Monthly: Review access logs for suspicious activity
- [ ] Quarterly: Review and update security headers
- [ ] Annually: Conduct security audit

### Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor Cloudflare logs for suspicious activity
- [ ] Check rate limiting effectiveness
- [ ] Monitor for unusual form submissions
- [ ] Review error logs regularly

## Known Vulnerabilities

### Current Issues
1. **nanoid vulnerability** (moderate severity)
   - Status: Known, needs dependency update
   - Impact: Predictable ID generation
   - Mitigation: Update @11ty/eleventy-plugin-webc when available

### Resolved Issues
1. ✅ Input validation added
2. ✅ Rate limiting implemented
3. ✅ Admin endpoint removed
4. ✅ Debug endpoint removed
5. ✅ Reduced attack surface

## Emergency Response

### If Security Breach Detected
1. Immediately disable the affected functionality
2. Review logs to understand the scope
3. Reset any compromised data
4. Update security measures
5. Document the incident

- Enable security headers
- Monitor logs regularly
- Have a rollback plan ready

## Compliance

### GDPR Compliance
- ✅ Privacy policy implemented
- ✅ No unnecessary data collection
- ✅ Data retention policies in place

### Data Protection
- ✅ Personal data is minimal and necessary
- ✅ Data is stored securely in Cloudflare KV
- ✅ Access to data is restricted and logged

## Future Improvements

### Planned Security Enhancements
1. Add request logging and monitoring
2. Implement CSRF protection
3. Add automated security testing
4. Set up security alerting
5. Regular security audits

### Long-term Goals
1. Regular security audits
2. Penetration testing
3. Security training for team members
4. Automated vulnerability scanning
5. Incident response plan
